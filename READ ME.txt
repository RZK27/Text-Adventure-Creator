Hello there!
You want to make a choose your own adventure story?
Here are the rules!

Your input text file, game.txt, must be mindful of newlines and order. Below is an example of how to set up the lines properly.

       0
   00     01
000 001 010 011

would be written in game.txt as 

0
00
01
000
001
010
011

You will notice that the choices are laid out are in order of depth first (the number of choices you'd need to make to reach it), then from
left to right; a collapsed version of the original option tree.


Every event is confined to one line of text in the text file. The between of two sentences is marked by a backslash instead of a space.
At the end of the line, to ask for choices ask the user to input A or B for certain options.

This is an example.\You see the backslashes?\They are needed.\A: You would like to go to the beach.\B: You would like to go shopping.


If you do not want to ask for choices as you want to end the path early, just end with \^

This is another example.\The end.\^


WARNING: If you end a line in a path early, you MUST include the rest of what the path could have been in the document; it should NOT be empty. Below is a proper example.
Advanced: They actually can be empty so long as the last line of the text file is not.

How are you?\A: Good, B: Bad
Great!\Why are you at the doctor's then.\^
I'm not a registered practitioner but I'll try my best.\Is it your ankle?\A: Yes how did you know? B: No...
ooga
booga
Because, I am you.\From the future.
Lies.\I do not believe you.

Notice that I did not place a \^ after those last two lines. This is because \^ is only necessary for early ends.

Bonus: Put @ in a sentence to clear the screen after the sentence is read.


Advanced: In order to send the end of a path to another path (without asking for a choice), use \#n, where n is the number of the line
you are sending the user to. This is to be placed at the end of the line. Note that this follows the same rules as \^, meaning you
MUST include the rest of what the path could have been in the document. Treat it as an early end or the code will not work. If you don't
want the user to have to press enter to jump to the new route, just put #n. This is handy for when you have a line that is empty but for
this command.

How are you?\A: Good, B: Bad
Great!\Why are you at the doctor's then.\^
I'm not a registered practitioner but I'll try my best.\Is it your ankle?\A: Yes how did you know? B: No...
ooga
booga
Because, I am you.\From the future.
Lies.\I do not believe you\#3

Here, if the user makes it to "I do not believe you", they will be then transported to "I'm not a registered practitioner..." and continue from there.

Every game.txt file must have a number of lines one less than a power of 2. The last example had 7, which is one less than 8.
As long as all the other steps are followed above, this will happen naturally. If not, something went wrong somewhere, and the code will not run.

To make the game a little more personal, you can also edit title.txt to print a title screen when the program starts.
Functions and other rules do not apply there, it will just be printed to the console as you write in the text file.	

Good luck!
