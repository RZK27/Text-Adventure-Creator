Warning: This story touches on mental illness and sensitive materials.@\Mommy doesn't like caterpillars.\They make you itch.\Our house has many caterpillars, but I have not seen them.\Mommy screams at night when she finds them.\They crawl under her skin, and I get to help scare them out.\I am not scared of caterpillars.\When it is night, and Mommy is not home, I go into her room and see the caterpillar medicine.\It is to make the caterpillars go away.\A: Grab it, B: Leave: 
Suddenly, I hear the front door open.\It was not locked.\I grab the medicine and hide under her bed.\Under here it is not clean.\The bag is plastic, crinkling in my hands.\It is cold.\I want to hide in my room.\A: Run for my room, B: Stay under the bed:
I go to my room.\I do not have any toys.\Sometimes I play with the dust in the corner of my room.\Today I look out my window.\It is dark outside.\I do not think Mommy will be back soon.\Suddenly, I hear the front door open.\I hear the person make his way around the apartment, into the living room and down to the kitchen.\The person begins to make their way to my room.\A: Barricade door, B: Do nothing: 
I get out from under the bed.\My pants are dusty.\I quickly slip into the hallway.\Daddy saw me.\I run into my room and close the door.\Mommy told me not to talk to Daddy.\I hide under my blanket.\I hear his footsteps near my door.\He waits there for a moment before heading back.\I could hear him leave the house, closing the door behind him.\A: Go and lock the door, B: Go to sleep: 
I stay under the bed, trying not to breathe.\The dust from the ground is making my throat feel very dry.\I hear the person's footsteps roam our house.\After walking down to the kitchen, he makes his way up the hallway in front of the room.\He comes into Mommy's room.\In front of me, I can see that this is Daddy.\Daddy starts to cry.\A: Step out, B: Stay hidden: 
I begin to push my small closet in front of the door.\It makes a loud screeching sound.\The footsteps stop before I can finish blocking the door.\They do not move closer, and instead I hear the front door close, quietly.\The intruder has left.\A: Go and lock the door, B: Go to sleep: 
I wait, hiding under the blanket.\I hear the footsteps pass my door and enter Mommy's room.\I hear a loud crash with shattered glass, followed by a grunt.\The mirror must have fallen.\The footsteps rush back, pausing by my door briefly, and leave, closing the front door behind them.\A: Go to Mommy's room, B: Go to sleep: 
I head over to the front door.\Before locking it, I look into the forest outside.\It should be at least another week before Mommy turns into a butterfly.
I decide not to worry.\I put my head on the pillow, hoping Mommy hurry up.
I step out, taking him by surprise.\He looks at me, then looks at the medicine in my hands.\He grabs it and tosses it onto the ground.\He holds my shoulders and begins to cry.
I stay hidden under Mommy's bed.\Daddy is not leaving.\Suddenly I have the overwhelming urge to cough.\I hold my mouth over my hands, but it is no use.\I cough into the bag so as to not make noise, but the medicine goes flying everywhere.\Daddy finds me, and pulls me out from under the bed.\He looks worried.

I quietly go to Mommy's room.\The mirror was pushed off of the wall and onto the floor, with glass everywhere.\I am careful not to step on any.\I look around.\The medicine is gone.\The intruder must have wanted to take it, and that is why he came in.\He must be scared of caterpillars too.
